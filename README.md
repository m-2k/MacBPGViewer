# MacBPGViewer

MacBPGViewer is a native, open source <a href="http://bellard.org/bpg/">BPG</a> image viewer for Mac OS X. 

BPG (Better Portable Graphics) is a new image format developed by <a href="http://www.bellard.org">Fabrice Bellard</a>. Its purpose is to replace the JPEG image format when quality or file size is an issue.

You can download a pre-built binary of version 1.0 here: 

* [Download MacBPGViewer 1.1](http://sveinbjorn.org/files/software/macbpgviewer/MacBPGViewer.zip) (Intel 64-bit, 10.10 or later, ~1.9 MB)

To learn more about the BPG image format, read [this page](http://bellard.org/bpg/).

MacBPGViewer uses <a href="https://github.com/chuganzy/HCImage-BPG/">`HCImage-BPG`</a> for BPG decoding.
